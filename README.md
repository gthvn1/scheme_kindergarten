We will follow the book *"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"*. A [free copy online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) is available with [videos of the lectures by the authors](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/).

More tutos, books and cool stuff are available at [https://schemers.org/](https://schemers.org/).

As **scheme** is the language used we will use [GNU Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/).
